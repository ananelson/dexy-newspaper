This template uses the sciposter class to create a very large page. You need to
set the custom paper size in your texlive install, I have found this file in
locations such as:

/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/tex/latex/sciposter/papercustom.cfg
/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/sciposter/papercustom.cfg

You can try running "find /usr -name papercustom.cfg" to locate this file on
your installation.

\renewcommand{\papertype}{custom}
\renewcommand{\fontpointsize}{14pt}
\setlength{\paperwidth}{28.9cm}
\setlength{\paperheight}{38.0cm}
\renewcommand{\setpspagesize}{
  \ifthenelse{\equal{\orientation}{portrait}}{
    \special{papersize=28.9cm,38.0cm}
    }{\special{papersize=38.0cm,28.9cm}
    }
  }

Note that in our document, we have margins set to:

\setmargins[1.5cm]
